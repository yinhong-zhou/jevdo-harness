 * Jev approves for the user. In Jev mode a call that would otherwise ask the
 * user (a command, a change outside the project, an action on the outside
 * world, a sub-agent) is put to the judge first: is it a step the task needs,
 * done the way the user would expect? Only a sure yes lets it run. Anything
 * else, and no verdict at all, goes to the user, with what Jev saw.
 *
 * One choice question rather than booleans: choice distributions are sharp on
 * clear cases, and "beyond" versus "unrelated" tells the user why they are
