/**
 * B1, admission control for tool output: tokens that never enter the context
 * are the cheapest ones, and keeping them out costs no prompt cache. One
 * judgment per chunk, so a judge with a small window can do it too.
 *
 * The question asks what a chunk IS, not whether it is relevant to the agent's
 * intent. Measured on the local judge (kyrn/docs/03-local-judge.md): the
 * relational form called every chunk relevant, noise included, while this
 * classification put 4 of 4 noise chunks and 3 of 3 errors in the right class.
 *
 * Only a confident noise class drops a chunk. The caller archives whatever it
 * drops and leaves a one-line pointer, which keeps a wrong verdict recoverable.
