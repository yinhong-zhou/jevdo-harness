/**
 * C5, the way back from an isolated sub-agent. In the hive the judge gates
 * what passes between bees; here it looks at what a worker wants to bring
 * into the user's working tree: does the change stay within the task, and
 * which files have nothing to do with it (a lockfile, a reformatted module).
 *
 * It sees the task, the changed paths and the line counts, never the diff.
 * The verdict is a line of text next to the patch for the parent model to
 * weigh. It never blocks: applying a patch is the parent's call.
