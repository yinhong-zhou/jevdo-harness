/**
 * Input preflight: one batched judge call per user message, before the main
 * model runs. Output is free and questions are answered in parallel, so the
 * whole triage costs about one small request.
 *
 * It decides the "gear" for the turn: what gets loaded around the main model
 * (memory, skills, swarm, plan step, thinking level).
 *
 * Wording rules, measured with kyrn/spikes/judge-bench on a small local judge
 * (see kyrn/docs/03-local-judge.md): one short concrete predicate per question,
 * state fields named in backticks, no enumerations ("created, edited, or
 * deleted") and no compound conditions. On 31 labelled messages the long form
 * of `needs_files_changed` scored 42% and the short form 74%, same model, same
 * state. Bump `version` whenever a question or the state layout changes.
