/**
 * H1/H2, the hive's two gates. Bees work in separate context windows, which
 * is what lets a hard problem be attacked from several sides at once, and
 * also why swarms duplicate work and contradict each other: nothing one bee
 * learns reaches the others. Sharing everything floods every context; letting
 * each bee's main model decide what to share is slow, costly, and forgotten.
 *
 * So the judge does it, once per step, like the judges of a waggle dance:
 * H1 decides whether what a bee just said or saw is news for the hive, and
 * H2 decides, per bee, whether a piece of news matters to what that bee is doing.
