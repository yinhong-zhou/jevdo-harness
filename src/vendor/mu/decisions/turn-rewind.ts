 * Judged rewind. The monitor knows THAT the agent goes in circles (a rule) or has drifted; whether the
 * approach itself is a dead end is a judgment. Only a confident dead end with no progress proposes
 * going back to the turn's checkpoint, and proposing is all it does: the user confirms, never the judge.
 *
 * The cheapest recovery from a dead end is the state before it, plus one line about what was learned,
 * instead of more fixes on a broken path and the whole failed attempt carried in the context.
